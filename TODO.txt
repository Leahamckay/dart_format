TODO
====
- Indent assignments when multiline
- Error "Missed some text" does not fully carry over to the plugin when the text contains <text> e.g. <DartFormatException>.
- favicon.ico does not work when called from plugin.
- integration tests for indentation=-1
- integration tests for maxEmptyLines
- maxEmptyLines can only work when removeLeadingWhitespace does not already remove all empty lines.
- tests for FormalParameterListFormatter, ... (test preservation/removal of trailing comma)

DONE (I Think)
==============
- Block comments: keep indentation
- Method params: indent when multiline with "(" and "({"
