TODO
====
- Add tests from other machine (format the complete Flutter checkout)
- Error "Missed some text" does not fully carry over to the plugin when the text contains "<" or ">"
-- e.g. <DartFormatException>.
-- e.g. offset < lastConsumedPosition
- favicon.ico does not work when called from plugin.
- Integration tests for indentation=-1
- Integration tests for maxEmptyLines
- maxEmptyLines can only work when removeLeadingWhitespace does not already remove all empty lines.
- Tests for FormalParameterListFormatter, ... (test preservation/removal of trailing comma)
- Block comments: keep indentation
- Own lint rule: don't return Futures in a try-catch block.
- Own lint rule: don't call unawaited stuff in a try-catch block.
- Own lint rule: don't return Future<void>s.
- Ensure DEBUG is off when publishing
- Safety: don't accept result if length is 0 or very short, e.g. when throwing UnimplementedError in StringTools.
- No blank lines between {{ and }}
- No blank line after { and before }
- Investigate line endings. Keep existing style, but also offer option to convert.
- No more than maxEmptyLines blank lines at file end.
- Keep "{}" if it doesn't contain line breaks.
- Indent "((){});" if contains line breaks.
- else\nif
- Indent interpolations?
- Force line break after if/else/...
- Add/remove spaces
- Fix too big block indentation after "if () // comment\n"
- Sort imports
- Remove empty lines at start and end
- Spaces: "a . b"
- Do not remove trailing commas from end-of-line comments

DONE (I think)
==============
- Method params: indent when multiline with "(" and "({"
- WebService: Shut down if calling process dies.
- Quit doesn't work anymore
- Simplify TestAstVisitor
- Don't add line break between "}" and ";"
- Don't add line break between "}" and ","
- Indent assignments when multiline
- Important: Undetected change from "â‚¬" to "?". Maybe change of encoding? Is this the cause for the problem undetectable changes, too?
- Indent triple quoted strings
